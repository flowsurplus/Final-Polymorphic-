There are many differences that I implemented into the SuperHero polymorphism assignment 
in contrast to the first Polymorphism assignment. 
One main difference I implemented was
the inclusion on a Polymorphic Array. I used this array to access the Polymorphic methods of 
'doThis' and 'equals". 
The second difference I implemented was an opening menu that is user interactive and implements switch
statements to route the user in the right options. 
The third difference I implemented was the inclusion of abstract methods to store messages that would appear in the
main menu, the detailed list of superheroes, as well as the sorted groups of superheroes. 
The final and fourth difference would be the inclusion of a 'for loop' to sisplay the polymorphic doThis methods in each 
class.
